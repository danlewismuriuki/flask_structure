# Flask Project Structure

This repository explores different ways to structure a Flask application beyond the single-file approach. Properly organizing a Flask project can improve maintainability, scalability, and readability, especially as the project grows.

## Project Overview

Flask is a lightweight web framework that allows for flexibility in how projects are organized. While it is easy to start with a single file (e.g., `app.py`), it's best practice to separate concerns as the project scales. This repository demonstrates several patterns and structures for organizing a Flask application.

## Structures Covered

1. **Single File App**: A simple Flask app with everything in a single file. This is suitable for small projects or quick prototypes.

2. **Blueprint Structure**: Organizes the app using Blueprints to separate different parts of the application (e.g., authentication, main site). This structure is more suitable for medium-sized projects.

3. **Package Structure**: Organizes the app into a package with submodules for routes, models, forms, and configurations. This is ideal for larger projects where code separation is necessary.

4. **Factory Pattern**: Uses the application factory pattern to create Flask instances. This approach allows for greater flexibility and better testing support by creating multiple instances of the app with different configurations.

5. **Modular Structure with Extensions**: Organizes the app using extensions for database handling, authentication, etc. This structure is highly modular and scalable.

## Getting Started

To run any of the example structures:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_structure.git
   cd flask_structure
